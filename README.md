ATARI Fuji Logo with rainbow

tschak909 started a small 'competition' on AtariAge.com forums, when he
presented his version of ATARI Fuji logo with rainbow. Find the discussion here:

This is my little part of this 'fight'. You're free to do what you want with this.

rainbow_fuji:			first version, just logo and rainbow moving down only
rainbow_fuji_up_down:		second version with additinal change in moving direction
rainbow_fuji_with_r_up_down:	added the registraion mark as ATARI would have done back
				in the days + warm reset, when user wants to exit
